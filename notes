Dont store templates in the database, having them on disk doesnt require a database to load them. This in case something goes wrong.

rename PluginData.php to Data.php.
rename PluginData.php getTags method to getPublicTags.

Decide if the TagEngine should have the data tags registered already or if it should look in the database for them.
If it looks into the database this could reduce the time needed to initialize the tag engine.

Also think about plugin tags, should they be registered as functions in the TagEngine itself or stored as strings so the PluginManager can handle them.

Maybe tie system tags directly to the core to ensure they exist when needed.

Split plugin functionality into website and cms classes.

Other tags the core needs can be defined as data tags and function tags.

Split database functionality for the system itself in a seperate engine.

Think about how cores should work and extend it accordingly. They are a mess at the moment.

Create a Page Engine cores can use to show pages.
