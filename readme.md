## FAQ
###### Why are you using SQLite as your database?
  I break my server very often and need to reinstall everything. Having a database file at the ready instead of reinstalling a SQL server saves me alot of hassle. :)
###### Will I be able to use this cms?
  Ofcourse! Even tho this cms is for personal use its my intention to make this cms as simple as possible to use and extend for others.
